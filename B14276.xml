            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>The which heauenly saying, dayly we fynde most true, albeit, many of those greate and hidden benefytes: preordinate by prouidence diuine: were vnknowen many yeares, to many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyons. Insomuch, as husbandry an arte most comune: and now of least conning: was long vnknowen: men liuing on the fruits
<pb facs="tcp:8344:3"/>of the Erth, without any manurÄce, as beasts: for vntil Dionisius his time, it was vnknowen amÅgst the EgipciÄs, &amp; vntil Charles the fith Monarche, amongst the IndiÄs: as Diodorus, Polydorus and Martine Curtesse affirmeth: and in Greece and Asia, vntill Triptolemus: In Italie, vntill Saturnus: as Macrobius shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. So was, vvyne, Oyle, Honie, Ale, Beere, Bread, Cheese, and infinite other thinges, after orderlie appointed, to our vses as doth appeare And, Bacchus vvas the fyrst, that of Barly made Ale, for the Egipcyans: bicause as then they had no Grapes: the which we Britaines vse still, and they of Germanie, and Flan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dres, beere.

            <p>So that by these and ten thousand others, we may gather, that Gods good gyfts haue not all at one time bin reuealed, nor at one instant to al nacions auayled, but some by one, in one time, some by another in another time, and all as it pleased his infinit bountie, to ayde and benefite his creatures with: as by king Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dud the Britten were first erected the bathes of Bath: So now we may say by your honour, the bathes of Buckstone to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficially edified, worthy euery where to be notified.</p>
            <p>Of the which, by Gods help, and your honours protection,
<pb facs="tcp:8344:3"/>somewhat shalbe shewed hitherto vnknowen, that the benefite thereof, may the better be perceaued.</p>
            <p>The which worke, howsoeuer it be, I beseech your Noblenes to accept, as that which of most right, to you of duety belongeth. And, forasmuch as your care hath ben therein, to the benefyte of all: It is right that of all, you should be highlie magnified, for your vertuouse exployte, accomplishing of so noble a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyte, and that in this our age, when as the most sort, are giuen to seeke worldlie gayne, rather then the publique proffet (the more pittie it is to speake it) and that such, as to themselues, and theyrs, onelie, might belong. But your vertuouse industry, is, &amp; hath ben, for the benefyt, of the vniuersall people of God: as a thing, descending from your parents: and of you enherited. Therfore, to you mightie Erle I dedicate, these my labours, and playne Treatise, entytuled <hi>Buckstones Benefyte,</hi> bicause, by you is accomplyshed, and notified, euery wher, that which was in a maner hydden, and vnknowen, to all a far of, and vnto the most neere hand. If, I should here shew, how greatlie they are to bee extolled: that take such paine, and be at such cost: for the wele publique: I might rather make a newe volume: then fynish this. As it may easilie appeare, by that which is already expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. VVherfore, I will stay my pen, for that, I confesse my selfe farre vnable: to set out the condigne prayses: that eyther too your honour belonge, for the true loue assurid Loyaltie, and great trust: vnto your puissance comitted: or the worthy benefytes: that the Bathes, or vvels, of Buckston do yelde.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, great Alexander, retained with him in great fauour: one that wrote his hystory: albeit, it was not most ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantlie penned (as Quintus Curtius affirmeth) bicause, it might encourage, some of more eloquence, to take in hand, the like enterpryse: for, otherwise what had auayled the fame of hys conquest? when that age had expired, if none had taken in hand: for the posterities to haue remembred: whose example herein I haue folowed.</p>

So hard it is for any man, be it neuer so frÄdly intÄded: neuer so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously laboured: neuer so profitable, for, the wele publike: to set forth any thing, for al mens liking, that euen most of the wisest sort (as many men think) set forth nothing by printing: bicause, many now a daies are giuÄ, to the searching out ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (if they cÄ) to blot him, with the lest matter (if there bee no greater) and let the common profyt, then too seeke the thinge that may all men benefyte, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:8344:6"/>the same to commend, or therto too adde any credite.</p>
            <p>These, and such lyke causes, haue letted many (as I deme) frÅ the attempting of this (howsoeuer it be) which I haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, of Buckstons benifite: aduen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turing rather for my part, to be stong of the Drones, then to leaue the good hony vnsought and to be barked at, with such vnkind curs, then to leaue the Master of the house helples: trusting that the wise, Graue, Learned, Curteouse, &amp; Louing sort, wil accept the endeuour of him, who asmuch as in him lieth (for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> tyme) doth seeke, how he may best profit the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall people of God, and in speciall, hys owne countrymen that bee vexed with such greuous sicknesses, as they despaire of remedy, by any other meanes.</p>
            <p>Galen, whÄ he came first to Rome, sent for by Marcus Aurel. Willing his Lief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, that he shuld honorably furnishe him with men, money, horse, &amp; municion as very noblie he did: for that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous greatly of his consayle. Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus his sonne being very sicke of a feuer,
<pb facs="tcp:8344:6"/>the which at the first sight, hee presaged (for that the Crisis so prognosticated, a knowledge by him throughly labored, as he that was most expert in phisicke) that he should haue his fit no more: whereat, the Phisicions of the Emperours hyghe councell, meruayled, &amp; whÄ they saw the effect, greatly disdayned (for such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they had not studied) where they should haue louingly embraced him, and highly haue cÅmended him, for Tagalti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>us saieth, the maners that to Phisicions belonged, are that thei be of gentle enter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taynement, curteouse, &amp; friendly toward such as be of their own professiÅ, in greek termed Philateiras. But what did hee? leaue his well dooing for all their enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? no truly. So much was hee gyuen the vniuersall world to profyt, more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly proceeded forward in all good doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as by his workes made there, both against Erasistratus, cÅcerning letting of blood: and against Thessalus Trali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, about the healing of vlcers, maye appeare: prouing &amp; reprouinge, by most waighty arguments, &amp; best authorities,
<pb facs="tcp:8344:7"/>al that he did not waying the disdain of a fewe, so that he might profyt all, as no dout he hath al the world. Let Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus (&amp; all other vayn practisers do what they can) with his fyre work, of three be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, of salt, Brimstone, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer, blowing the coles vnto ashes, and stilling til they haue no glasses, as wyse as geese, as reasonable as apes, as trim as Colyers, and as riche as newe shorne sheepe.</p>
            <p>Now seeing Galen, in whÅ was heaped as in a grainard: all knowledge both philosophicall, &amp; phisicall, was enuyed, disdained, backbyted, and yet of some is: what shal I think to go scotfre, that am so far inferiour vnto him, as is the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, vnto the maister? No no, therefore I will arme my head with patience: and my harte with a cleare Conscience, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing before GOD: and men, (which thorow the enuiousnes of the time I am driuÄ vnto) that this, that I haue done, I haue done neyther of a proud mynd, ambicious desire, or ouerwening in my selfe, but of a very feruent zeale, to the
<pb facs="tcp:8344:7"/>preseruation of health, and mayntay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of lyfe: bycause I sawe so many repaire thither, without al order. By meanes whereof, some went away very sick, that came thither indyfferent well. Some neuer a whit the better: whiche if they had had good counsail, might. And some, more by hap then by cunning: as it dyd them no good, so dyd it them no harme.</p>
            <p>These things wayed, I began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with my self, of many things dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whether it were better, to let passe, as other wiser, &amp; better lerned thÄ I had done such matters, or to procede therein. The which, whÄ I had attÄpted, more and more I saw was too bee sayde, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to haue gone no further: thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene dout and despair, hapned to come vnto me, of the lerned some, &amp; other of the gentility, wise &amp; expert that feared God, loued their country: and hearing that I had begon suche a matter of Buckstone, as I had of Bath: instÄtly desired mee, to goe forward, affirming, I should doo a gratefull deed too the common weale
<pb facs="tcp:8344:8"/>of my natiue coÅ«try, &amp; that for the north parts, &amp; West: aswel as the South: yea &amp; if it were not so well done as some others of more wisedome, learning, &amp; experience could, (as I think of my self it is not) yet bicause it should encourage some other, if they saw myne not sufficient to amende (as it is easier then to begin) that which I haue rudely rouded ouer. Albeit al that which I haue done, is collected out of the best writers in phisick: and for these .xiiii. yeres &amp; more, proued. Trusting it will be wel accepted, seeing the profit is thyne, &amp; the labor myne. But if ther be any so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionated to Rhetorique, that vnlesse they find a moulhil made a mountayne, or an Emet, an ElephÄt, think the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnperfect let them consider that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Non cupit ornari, cupit, &amp;c.</hi> Or if, they suppose knowledge nothinge worthe, vttered in their own language. ThÄ I must nedes say, they shall find this of Buckstons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyt, &amp; also Bathes aide vnperfect. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit, of this if they consider, they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily fynde whether a thing briefely and plainly taught, bee better, or a thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
<pb facs="tcp:8344:8"/>&amp; intricate: and whether a thinge familiar, or a thing straunge be easiest to iudge of, what neede many wordes? If a longe discourse had more needed, then a short: Hippocrates had not written his Aphorisines, nor Galen Ars parua: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they writen in Greeke, when as all Grece vnderstoode Greeke, aswell as they, or we in England english. But had deuised some new tongue: a matter of no great labour: for the DrawcabiÅ tongue of fiue yeares standing, as it was in a day inuented. So was it in a weeke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: &amp; is with some, for their pleasures in daily vse. But these toies, were far frÅ their meaning, &amp; so I dout not, but they be now from the wyse, or els, the guide of the soule, Gods woord, had not bin in our owne tongue vttered, nor of Paule, so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And therfore, if with the matter any be offended, let thÄ be offended with the best learned, whose example herein I haue followed, and out of whom this is collected. If the phrase like them not, I wishe them to thinke, so many men, so many wittes: so many styles, so many
<pb facs="tcp:8344:9"/>deuises, as you haue hard. If the style be to playne, I would haue them to remÄ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whether heuy things be easier of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, or light: and briefly to conclude, whether their own familiar spech: their own lawes: or the Romains be better, &amp; easyer, too Iudge of. Too conclude, if the matter be best whiche the approued writers, obserue &amp; affirme: then I dare say, this is not all ill. If the phrase be best that is most playn, thÄ this is not worst. If the style or endyting be best which cÅ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth the matter: then this is not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to bee disallowed. In fyne, if the mother tongue be most meete for hir own children, and easyest to be vnderstanded, then this in our own, you will affirme, is not to bee abandoned. So that I wil thus ende.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>VEN</hi> as, in our former Treatise, of the Bathes of Bathe, we haue shewed the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, comoditie, propertie, vse, dyete, Aphorismes, &amp; medicines, with all thinges requisite, in our iudgement, for to bÃ©e no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and obserued of all such as ther intend (through knowledge) to sÃ©eke any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. So, now it resteth that in this Treatice wÃ©e expresse lykewise the Benefyte of Buckstons Bathes, or Welles, in the hygh Peke, in the Countie of Darby, ten myles from the woorthie Edifices, Chatsworth <hi>.16.</hi> myles from Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>.16.</hi> myles from Market Chester field <hi>.20.</hi> from Darby, <hi>30.</hi> from the famouse and auncient Citie Westchester, <hi>30.</hi> from the Citie of Lychfield, <hi>30.</hi> from Stafford.</p>
            <p>Of the origine, of the name, and why it was called Buckstons well, I neyther could reade it in any Authour, nor heare of any as yet. This is asmuch, as I suppose, may bÃ©e gathered thereof, that it hath the name of the Towne: and the Towne lykewyse hath the name of some one so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (for of such there bÃ©e diuers) and the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> aswell as the <hi>Britaynes</hi> were wont to name their townes after their own names, as it is euidÄt of very many places in this lande: and a Saxon, or English name it is, and no Brittish, or Welsh: And therefore, sithence <hi>Engistus,</hi> it hath his denomination. Howbeit, many yeares past, it was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented for the health of thousandes, by bathing them: as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as it is in these our dayes. For, betwÃ©ene Burghe and it, there is an high way forced ouer the moores, all paued,<note place="margin">Buckstones Bathes of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</note> of such antiquity as none can expresse, called Bathgate: albÃ©e it more of a superstitiouse hope they had in thywell, than of
<pb facs="tcp:8344:10"/>
               <q rend="inline">any affiance thei had in the qualitie, tÄperature, or property of the Bath: for of it and the vse therof, they were ignorant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, It is not vnlikely that the stagges or buckes wounded, would take soyle ther, and there the fosters of the forrest, called it Buckstand: but in my iudgement, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer supposition is more likely. And as for Cottrels tale, or the vayne inuencions about S. Aune found in the well, or of the water fet from flood Iordan. I reckÄ not them worthy the recitall. Therefore, I will not detayne you with suche tryfles, our dayes being so short: and the reason of the arte, so hard to attayne, (as <hi>Hypocrates, 1. lib. Aph. primo</hi> sayeth) passing ouer, the distinction of bathes here in this Treatise, and definition of artificiall: bicause in my first booke of the Bathes of Bathe, they be shewed, contenting vs with the naturall.</p>
            <p>Naturall bathes be those, which flow throw the entralles of the earth: taking their effect of such things, as they runne thorow,<note place="margin">SignificatiÅ of Bathes.</note> and receyue power by: for many infirmities moste auaylable. The differences of which hose naturall Bathes of Buckstone, by what meanes, of what mynerals, for what grÃ©efes, infirmities, and sicknes they serue best, shal be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted with all possible breuity, as far foorth as herein my iudgement is necessary: sÃ©eing that in our seconde Booke of Bathes ayde, you may find such things sufficiently skÄned: and therefore vnnÃ©edfull here of repeticion.</p>
            <p>First of the chÃ©efe Bathe which is the warmer springe, voyde in effect of all corrupcion, arguing therfore, no great quantitie of brimstone (as in Bathe) nor of allume, as some haue bruted. For then it should not onely bÃ©e of another col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, marly yellow, or swarty grÃ©ene: but also it might sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be perceyued by taste: albeit I acknowledge that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> affirmeth, that there is no such hose spring, without y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> myne of brymston And I think with <hi>Fal.</hi> &amp; <hi>Sauona. Rubr. de therm.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Falopius li. de Soss.</note> none without firie heat: although the quantitie may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8344:10"/>differ: and that may wel appeare. For if the quantitie were equal and like to the mynerals in Bath, the heat of as great force, fortified with like <hi>Antiparistasis,</hi> and as nÃ©ere to the head, then it should little in that respect, vary from Bathe. But it sÃ©emeth &amp; sure it is so, that Buckstons bathes haue not the fourth part of that heate which the bathes of Bathe haue, nor the other mynerals that bÃ©e ther. For Buckstons is much like as if a quart of boyling water were commixed with a galond of cold water. But Bath is, as if too a galond of sÃ©ething water were put a quart of cold water. By reason wherof, it attrecteth and dissolueth more spÃ©edly. But buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone more swÃ©etly, more delicatly, more finely, more daint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more temperatly: not bringing halfe so many grÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouse accidentes as Bath doth, yit lesse spÃ©edly: but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of tyme, very effectuousely, and for many infirmities,<note place="margin">No greuous accident fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones Baths</note> more commodiously, restrayninge vnnaturall issues, and strengthning the fÃ©eble members: assisting the animall, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and naturall faculties: dispersing opilacions, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying grÃ©efes.</p>
            <p>The well springes be situate in a valley, hard by a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning brooke, and runneth into it. Where at the mÃ©eting you may sensibly percegue and fÃ©ele the hot water on the one syde of the riuer, and the colde on the other. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, so commixed after, that it letteth the riuer of fresshing, in the coldest weather, for the space of a quarter of a myle, an argument of the power of the heate of those springes which be thrÃ©e especiall, and those very excellent, and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall for diuers distemperatures, grÃ©efes and sicknesses,<note place="margin">iij cheefe Bathes at Buckstone</note> as hereafter shalbe further shewed, God assisting.</p>
            <p>But there be fiue or fixe other, although not so good: yet it maye bÃ©e presupposed, that if there were boryers, suche as mynerall men vse in searching ore: too meete with the Springes, of somme of the other, that the colde water, which is commixed wyth the hote, myght bÃ©e turned away:
<pb facs="tcp:8344:11"/>that then no doubt,<note place="margin">The run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the springs in the baths of Buckstone.</note> they would bÃ©e more excellent. For that the more cold infirmities, might be cured by them, bÃ©eing made more hot. For vndoutedly, as myne one foote should steppe on the hot spring, the other would light on a colde: yea the one finger, I might put in the one, and another in the other, especially in those below. <q rend="inline">Howbeit, you may find in any some alteration, albeit not so much by a greate deale.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Ioyning to the chÃ©efe springe, betwene the riuer, and the Bathe, is a very goodly house, foure square, foure stories hye,<note place="margin">A goodly house and buildings of the Earle of Shrewsbury vppon the bathes syde.</note> so well compacte, with houses of office, beneath and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, &amp; round about, with a great chambre, and other goodly lodgings, to the number of. <hi>30:</hi> that it is and wilbÃ©e a bewty to behold: &amp; very notable for the honorable and worshipfull, that shal nÃ©ede to repaire thither: as also for other. Yea, the porest shal haue lodgings, &amp; beds hard by, for their vses only. The baths also so brauely beutified with seats round about: defended from the ambyent ayre: and chimneys for fyre, <q rend="inline">to ayre your garmintes in the Bathes syde, and other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries most decent.</q> And truely, I suppose that if there were for the sicke a Sanctuarie, during their abode there, for all causes, sauing sacriledge, treason, murther, burglary, rape and robbing by the hye way syde,<note place="margin">A sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. market.

It is situate in a goodly seate, and that in an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and hungry soyle, passing healthy, and in tyme would grow, to bÃ©e very welthy: and the commons about, would bÃ©e reduced to great fertilitie, for the ground on the one side is full of Lyme stones, bringing good grayne: on the other, a fyne black moulde, and a grosse. <q rend="inline">Great pitie, that such commons in all places be no better manured, sÃ©eing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite thousandes, in the realme,</q> might the more bÃ©e main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,

And surely, the swÃ©etnes and pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the water, of the Bath: sheweth some excellent ore: rather then eyther Brimstone, allume, bitumen, iron, cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or any other such like, for then, it should in drinking be perceyued, by tast. Of all which tastes, looke in my second booke, of Bathes ayde. Albeit trew it is (as affirmeth <hi>Galen de sanit, tuenda</hi>) all such hot Bathes, of such minerals haue force of drying: but in these, you shall find no such sence, but so farye, so pleasaunt, and delectable, that it would sÃ©eme, to be a dulce Bathe, made by arte, rather then by nature. How beit the effect declares Brimstone to be therein, and therfore I would haue this of you to be noted,<note place="margin">A matter worth the noting.</note> that salt water throw often straining, vpon fresh sand, is made again swÃ©ete, I meane tasteles: and so may other waters of other mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles also, for the ayry part, being purified from the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in this wise, or by Lymbeck returneth againe, too hys owne nature, and so this may: both for bycause the interne heate, is far distant (as we haue said in another place) and also, the water running from far, through the fayre sandy earth, may be purified from the sent, of the mineralles, and so lose his taste, and yet, not without greate vertues, both manyfest, and hidden, as you may perceyue, by that which is and shalbe said. SÃ©eing we graunt God (<hi>Aristot,</hi> vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall nature) hath bestowed vppon vs these Bathes, for our great benefite, if so be that, ther can be nothing (as saith <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene de vsu partium</hi>) which better, or more redily, taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way distemperature, of heate, or cold actiue qualityes, or euacuateth, by the pores, the superfluous humores, then a dulce or pleasunt Bathe: or that also, maintayneth health more: for when as it is, by nature moyst, and moderately hot,<note place="margin">Effectes of the Bathes.</note> by humiditie, it humecteth dryeth, spronge of heate: by heate, it heateth) cold, caused of congeling: by moderate clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,

For (as <hi>Auicenne</hi> sayeth <hi>in Canon.</hi>) the weake members be aswell strengthened with such medicines, as temperately heate, aboue their naturall propertie, as eased of their griefe, by qualifying the discrasie, in any or all of the partes.

            <p>Qualitie is shewed by the constitucion of the sicknesse, which in things to be receiued <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath made plain writing in this manner, <hi>6. Epidemiorum.</hi> In sicknesse there

            <p>But before wÃ©e procÃ©ede any further, it shall not bÃ©e vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nÃ©edfull, to note vnto you, by the way, the tymes of sicknes vniuersall, which be foure: Beginning, Augmenting, state,<note place="margin">Tymes of Sicknesses.</note> and declining, as testifyeth <hi>Galene, libio de morborum tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus, &amp; primo de Crisibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quantitie, is discryed by the knowledge of the force of constitucion of the sicknesse, of the tyme, of the particular encrease, and of the strength, of the party affected. If so bÃ©e, that the full dyete encreseth, strength, the meane preserueth it, and the slenderest deminisheth it.</p>
            <p>Plentifull, is that which encreaseth the strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that which is made of new layd egges, of Phisicall confections, and of such holsome meates, as shalbÃ©e hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mencioned.</p>
            <p>The meane, or that which is neyther plentiful, nor spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. <hi>Galene</hi> called a temperate Diet, as that which is done by fewe meates and such as bÃ©e of small nourishment, as is the iuice of Ptysane.</p>
            <p>The slenderest is that which is appointed in the tyme of <hi>Crisis,</hi> which is, a soddayne alteration of nature, eyther into better or worse, as <hi>Galen</hi> defineth it <hi>lib. ter. praesagiorum cÅ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. pri. &amp; lib. secund. aphoris. comment. decimo tercio, &amp; vicesimo tercio: &amp; lib. pri. Epidemiorum, comment. 3.</hi> abstay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning altogither, or taking something of least nourishment, as is <hi>Mellicratum.</hi> Therfore, if vertues or strengthes, haue their lawfull powers, and the chiefest force of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sicknes looked for of nature, it shalbe lawful to vse a most slÄder diet.</p>
            <p>But if the strength bÃ©e weake, it shall not bÃ©e conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, without great hurte, but rather, too adde so muche nourishement, as of the Strength is diminished.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:8344:17"/>
            <p>For, euen as euacuation is made before concoction, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prouoked: so shall nourishement be had in a tyme not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to eate, to kÃ©epe the strength from vtter fayling, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicen</hi> teacheth <hi>primiphen. quarto.</hi> Whereby it commeth to passe, that oftentymes in fittes, meates be giuen. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sometime we must giue nourishment, in the shakinge of the fyt: the which thing, <hi>Galene</hi> testifyeth, <hi>de picrocholis, primo therapentites, 1. apho. com. 9.</hi> And sometyme, in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> very burning of the fitte, that is when any grÃ©euouse accident happeneth, dissoluing the strength, nature not aggrauated: for where the powers shalbe decayed, by reason of manyfest empting (as the same <hi>Galen</hi> sheweth,) or because of extreme sweat, dissoluing the strength, or else, by reason of ouerlong abstinence: all these thus affected, require nourishement most spÃ©edily.</p>
            <p>Contrariewise, they which by reason of grÃ©efe, or bicause of the state of the sicknesse, haue the faculties not stronge, doo nÃ©ede now and then euacuation rather, then filling: nay hÃ©e which giueth meate to such, is cause of great hurt, vntoo them. So much likely it is, that those which bÃ©e ignorant in Phisike, can appoynt what meates, or at what tymes, or what qualitie, or quantitie, to the sicke ought to be giuen. Hence it is made euident, that euery sicke persone doth not require nourishement.</p>
            <p>In euery sharpe sicknes, a most slender dyet is required. In mÃ©eker sicknesses, a larger dyete may bÃ©e permitted.</p>
            <p>In cronicke or longe diseases, we doo diminish the dyete, and very many of them, besydes feuers, are rid with a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dyete, as <hi>Auicenne</hi> testifyeth, <hi>quarti phen. primo.</hi> And therefore in the curing of the frenche poxe, wÃ©e finde, the newe Diete is not profitable,<note place="margin">The new dyet profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> as <hi>Nicolaus massa in tractatu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>suo, de morbo Gallico, Iohannes Aliuenar de hic Hispanica, Benedictus Victorius, de morbo Neapolitano, Vldericus Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonus, de morbo Gal.</hi> with infinite others, doo testifye.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:8344:17"/>
            <p>In state of the sicknes, wÃ©e muste vse a more slender, dyet, yet first so plentiful, that it may suffice the sick. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>Secundi Problemate, quinquagesimo secundo,</hi> in the beginning of the sickenes, it is good to gyue meate. <hi>Celsus,</hi> contrariwise affirmeth, abstinence in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the sickenes, to bÃ©e beste. But truely, the one is ment as (I think) of the time of sicknes vniuersall, and the other particuler, and of this mynd is <hi>Montinus, in compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio facultatis curatoriae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By panges or fits the quantitie is altered: and in them it shalbÃ©e conuenient to abstayn, for it behoueth to giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to them that by cyrcuites haue fittes: except perchance when the fitte doth begin to leaue. For then must meates be geuen, when heate shall come euen vnto the fÃ©ete. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with <hi>Auicen in Quarto phen. pri.</hi> Sometyme wÃ©e take away nourishment, often tymes we doo deminish, somtyme we make euen, somtyme we do encrease.</p>
            <p>It is wholly taken away, when we desire to empty hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores, bycause of disgestion, as in state, and in very sharp sicknesses, and in them that bÃ©e of matter. But in leane persons, and such as haue <hi>Hectica Febris,</hi> and that be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpcions, it ought to be increased.</p>
            <p>It is deminished, that the strength may bÃ©e by nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preserued to thend, that we may prouide for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, neyther ought nature too bÃ©e hindred with multitude of ouer much nourishment, as in augmenting, and in acute or sharp sickenesses, and in the cronike or long also, yet lesse then in the sharp. And it is deminished two wayes, for som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme we are compelled to lessen the qualitie, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the quantity, as in <hi>Bolysmus</hi> that doggish appetyte. And often tymes we are constrayned to encrease the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and deminish the quantity, and when wÃ©e endeuour too strengthen the body, and the nature of the stomacke is not strong enough, for a fuller diete.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:8344:18"/>
            <p>In the beginninges of sicknes, we do giue an euen dyet, which doth neyther augment, nor deminish the strength of the body. For first we must deale plenteously (as <hi>Galen</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>primo ad Glanconem</hi>) that the sicke may suffyce.</p>
            <p>In declination we do encrease, for it behoueth too make encrease, lyke to the deminishing, which was afore in state. Therfore <hi>Galen</hi> doth teach <hi>Tercio artis paruae,</hi> that the arte which doth refresh, and strengthen, is conuenyent for them that be whole.</p>
            <p>In sicknesses euen to be disgested, and in strong state, vse abstinence.</p>
            <p>When the strength is weakned, and the sicknes hard to ouercome. <hi>Galen</hi> commendeth <hi>Pri. ad Glanc,</hi> to vse a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger dyet</p>
            <p>The shewing of the manner of vse, is also taken of iiif. thinges afore said. For if the strength shalbe weake, and the disposition be of corruption of humours, or of want of them, wÃ©e shall giue the sicke but a little nourishment, a little in deede: bycause his weakenesse, cannot sustaine at once, the whole multitude of nourishment. And often bicause the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position nÃ©edeth many thinges: if so be that, wanting dooth nÃ©ede adding, and corruption clensing.</p>
            <p>If with weakenes of the vertues or strength, there shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bÃ©e neyther any wanting, nor any corruption, neyther yet lacke of naturall humoures, but that they shal abound, then we will giue fewe thinges, and seldome, and so much the rather, if the humours shall abound.</p>
            <p>But if ther shalbe want of humoures, or corruption, and the vertues strong, then we wil giue much meate, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as the disposition may requyre, and nature strong able to disgest it.</p>
            <p>If the vertues, powers, or strength shalbe strong, with a disposition of the pleurisy, then we wil giue seldome, and litle at once, bycause the preserued state dooth not neede
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8344:18"/>much.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in Somer tyme, often sew things must be giuen: for that then the body nÃ©edeth much adding, as those which be dissolued, through vapoures (as you haue hard) and haue but a weake strength.</p>
            <p>In the winter season, much may be giuen, by reason the actions be stronger, yet seldome, bycause the sicke doth not nÃ©ede very much, adding as they to whom, there is not much euacuation made.</p>

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ende of this vehement, shalbe alteration of breath: sÃ©eing in whom there is no alteration of breath, it is not to be called an exercyse. The which thing <hi>Galene</hi> testifyeth, <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro secundo, de sanitate tuenda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vtilitie of exercyses is double: one to the euacuation of excrementes: the other, to the conseruacion of the state of the body. For of vehement moouing, thrÃ©e things are obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Hardnes of the parts through dayly exercise: Encrease of naturall heate, and a Swift moouing of the breath.</p>
            <p>By hardnes of the partes, they be losse affected with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. By encrease of heat, not onely mighty attraction, is caused in the body, but also a spÃ©edier alteracion, a better nutricion, and a perfecter distribucion into all the partes. By benefyte wherof the solide partes be kept softe, and the moyst be thynned, and the small wayes of the whole body, be made more loose.</p>
            <p>But of the more vehement force, of the breath, followeth necessarily, all the meaptes to be clenzed. Nowe, if exercise woork this, with very many more, as the clensinge of the excrementes of all the bodye, at large expressed of <hi>Galene</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8344:22"/>in his workes <hi>de sanitate tuenda.</hi> It shall not be vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to appoint the tyme and measure of it. And bicause it helpeth disgestion, it ought not bÃ©e vsed, when multitude of raw meate is conteyned in the vessels, least it might bring great daunger vnto the state of good health, and further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the grÃ©efes of the sicke, by augmenting of iuyce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were (as is sayd) altered perfectly. So that the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise is best which is before meat: if so be that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bodyes which be vnpure, and vnpurged of commune excrementes, the more you nourish them, the more you hurt them: Of this, I suppose it is euident, that the time for exercise is best, when the last days meat is disgested with a double concoction, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well that which is in the stomacke, as that whiche is in the vessels of bloode: for then the tyme of meat, agayne draweth nye: and if you vse exercise sooner, or later, you shall eyther fill the body with rawe humoures, or encrease pale chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:8344:25"/>of the soft and hard, which wÃ©e will call meane, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. But, such Sophisticall cauillacions, in this woorke, we haue not determined to reproue, but rather howe health at Buckstone, is to be obtayned.</p>
            <p>Medicines possessing power of euacuating, for the health of the costyfe, and of them that abound with corrupcion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all exercises haue dominion: which in our fourth booke of Bathes ayde, more largely wÃ©e haue handled, here altoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther not to be omitted, (that in the absence of Phisicions may bÃ©e vsed) regarde had to the constitucion of the bodye, manner of sicknes, and present state: remembring this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that doses or qualities of medicines,<note place="margin">great regard to be had in the dosis of medicines.</note> are varyed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to complexion, case, tyme, age, region, nature, sicknes, dyete, arte, and tymes mutacion, as affirmeth <hi>Auicenne in Canon.</hi> and <hi>Amatus Lusitanus, centuria prima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, not possible to appoint a iust quantitie, these thinges, in euery person not considered: and bycause you are there in a colder climate, then is Bathe (as I haue sayde) you must make your Dose the greater, for the North per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons require a greater and stronger force, to alter their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then the Southerne, for that theire bodyes bÃ©e more hard, by meanes whereof the naturall actions bÃ©e stronger, and will turne the medicine into nourishement. And wÃ©e call, all that a medicine, which hath power to alter nature, sayeth <hi>Montanus, commentario primo, de simplicium medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentorum qualitatibus.</hi> For otherwyse it is not a medy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, but meat. Howbeit, <hi>Galene</hi> sayth, <hi>libro quinto, de sim.</hi> It maketh such iuyce, or humor, as it should haue expelled: so that it encreaseth rather sicknesse, then auoyde the cause. It shalbÃ©e good therefore, if you meane to vse them, a little to augmente the qualitie, as a fourth or fifth parte more, which will sufficiently tharpen them, as I haue often proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Howbeit, I had rather you should conferre wyth the learned, concerning the vse of my medicines, then vppon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8344:25"/>your owne skill receyue them, and yet all that I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, bÃ©e voyde of venyme, and will not hurt, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyt not.

And purgacion, sayeth <hi>Galene, Comm. sec. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Apho.</hi> is euacuation of humours, which doo molest with their qualitie. But purgacion is not onely gyuen, bycause of euill humoures abounding, but also by reason of the force of the sicknesse, and sometyme if supplyeth blood letting. For if the party bÃ©e weake, a gentle purge wil better serue, as may appeare, <hi>4. therapentices, &amp; quart. det. san. libris Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leni:</hi> for blood is the treasure of lyfe, not viciated.</p>
            <p>Purgacion, according to <hi>Hippocrat.</hi> is a clensing which by nature or artificially by arte is made.<note place="margin">Purgataons defined.</note> Also there is a gentle purgacion, which euacuateth from all partes, and an other from the place onely affected, and this is eyther vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall, or particular, as <hi>Gentilis</hi> declareth, <hi>1.3.</hi>

               <hi>Mesue</hi> calleth it an vniuersall purgacion, <hi>cap. de soda.

And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular hÃ©e calleth that, which bringeth matter, cluddered, lomped, or bagged, in any principall member, or parte: by the proper emunctuaries, as out of the head, by the nose, mouth, eares, eyes, palate, &amp;c. But this particulare maye not bÃ©e preferred before the vniuersall, except it bÃ©e in fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cases, as either bycause the matter doth not much abound in quantitie, wherefore it may suffise, if it be brought from a parte of the emunctuaries of that member, in whiche the sicknesse is, or else, bycause the part from whence the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            </p>
            <p>Lykewyse ther is one purgation drawing backward, and another foreward, the former turneth to the contrary, the other asyde, as sayth <hi>Hippoc. Libro de Succis.</hi> and <hi>Galen. 4. Therali. de Vlceribus.</hi> Hence it is apparent, that purgaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the belly, profiteth the most sorte greued with vlcers, as the same <hi>Hippoc</hi> affirmeth, ther is also one kynd of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion, that diminisheth, another that perfectly euacuateth all: The former diminisheth the sickenes, the later, wholly rooteth it out, and this is of twoo sortes, for eyther by one meanes, or other, it expelleth the filthy excrementes or else it diminisheth the fumity or iuyce hurtfull, as <hi>Conciliator</hi> saith <hi>Differencia, 116.</hi> and this is strong, weake, or meane, as which is caused of a laxatiue, strong, weake, or meane. Likewise some purgacion at once, worketh effectually, out of al the partes, and some by distaunce of tyme, or little and little.

            <p>Lastly of the preparation, of the body, and alteration of the humours, times of purgation, are to be receyued.

And to eate such meates, as thinne, cut and seperate grosse, clamy and tough humours, and that do open the passages.</p>
            <p>Again hÃ©e saith, bodies which shuld be purged, ought to be made flowing:<note place="margin">Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before purgations.</note> &amp; thei ar made flowing, as <hi>Ga.</hi> testifieth <hi>3. ap. 9.</hi> By extenuating, &amp; cutting of humoures, &amp; by opening the wayes, by which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> humours are drawÄ of the medicine.

            <p>Furthermore, coction must be loked first: especially in grosse, tough, and slimy humours, as <hi>Aetius</hi> teacheth <hi>Libro tercio.</hi> And in certayne chollerique infirmities, of thicke, and tough matter, as it is apparant with <hi>Galen,</hi> of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion giuen for the yelow Iaundis, <hi>Libro devi Catarthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, et de constitucione artis Medicae.</hi> The which thing, also <hi>Tralianus</hi> doth vse, and against <hi>Rasis</hi> and <hi>Auicenne,</hi> but not likewise, for the whayey, thinne, and subtyle humoures, which as it sÃ©emeth too <hi>Aetius,</hi> are too bÃ©e purged foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, in the beginning of the sicknesse.</p>
            <p>Briefly, before concoction, a purgacion is conuenient, in my iudgement, the manyfest quality of the humor compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the quantity and place, of this iudgemÄt is <hi>Antylus,</hi> and also <hi>Manardus libri tricesimi, epistola prima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In some the moouinge of nature, or of sicknesse, or of booth, dooth shewe the tyme of gyuing purgation.</p>
            <p>To these, the strength of the sicke, the condicion of the ayre, and what thinges haue gone before, and are present, or belonge too bÃ©e purged, (as <hi>Galene</hi> teacheth <hi>nono Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentices,</hi>) are too bÃ©e considered.</p>
            <p>If so bÃ©e that apte moouinges are to bÃ©e holpen, and the depraued to be corrected. And it is depraued, if before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, nature doo euacuate, sayth <hi>Leouellus in practica sua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also, if by places not conuenient, and then it is too bÃ©e transferred, as affyrmeth <hi>Valescus in Philonio suo.</hi> And in diseases of swift moouing, it often happeneth in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the rawe matter is euacuated, nature erringe, thorowe compulsion of sicknesse, as affirmeth <hi>Iohannes Ruellius.</hi> Which thinge, a skilfull Phisicion, soone kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth</p>

For it behoueth (sayeth hÃ©e) for the most parte, in euery simple, eyther to qualifie the hurte, or to stunne the force, or too strengthen the weaknesse, or to correct the vnpleasantnesse. So vnlikely it is that any simple may aunswere to bÃ©e cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent, for the curacion of sundrie affectes, whiche at once doo requyze diuers faculties, and at one instant, as is very learnedly sayde, of <hi>Celsus,</hi> and at large expressed of <hi>Montanus, in commentario de componendis medicamentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rule of <hi>Galene</hi> therefore is, that as farre as it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the medicine be made most pleasant, <hi>quarto de tuenda sanitate,</hi> peraduenture, according to that saying of <hi>Hippoc.</hi> The Phisicion ought to gratifye the sicke, in meates, drinkes, and medicines, <hi>sexto Epi.</hi> For in meate, there is a most excellent medicine, as he testifyeth.
